# Titanic Survival Prediction Challenge
This Jupyter Notebook is my submission to the Titanic Survival Prediction Challenge on Kaggle. In this competition, the task is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, etc.

The dataset contains information on 891 passengers, out of which 342 survived and 549 did not. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the survival outcome of passengers based on the given features.

## Data Source
The dataset for this competition can be found on the Kaggle website at the following link: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The data is provided in two CSV files - **train.csv** and **test.csv**.

## Approach
In this project, I have used Python programming language and several data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.

The following is a brief outline of the steps I have followed in this project:

- Data Loading and Exploration
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection and Training
- Model Evaluation and Fine-tuning
- Model Deployment and Prediction

## Results
After trying various models and fine-tuning the hyperparameters, I was able to achieve an accuracy of 78.229% on the test set.

## How to use the Jupyter Notebook
1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` command in the terminal.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook by running the `jupyter notebook` command in the terminal.
4. Open the `titanic-eda-and-prediction.ipynb` file in the Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells sequentially.

## Conclusion
This project was a great opportunity for me to apply my data science skills to a real-world problem and gain experience in feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. I hope my submission will help others learn from my approach and improve their performance in the competition.
